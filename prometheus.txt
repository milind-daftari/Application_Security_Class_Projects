Part 2.1: Remove unwanted monitoring

Here, I removed the piece of code which was collecting passwords and storing how many times a password was used.

Code-
        # KG: Uh... I'm not sure this makes sense.
        # Collect data to ensure good password use.
        if pword not in graphs.keys():
            graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
              + f'times {pword} was used') # Check
        graphs[pword].inc() # Check
